![Hi_laptop2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50955126/115201338-85f83500-a0f5-11eb-926f-4febbba7d406.png)   
   
    
    
🏃🏽‍♀️ A User-Focused-Product-Developer  
👏🏽  A graduate from [CodeOp's](https://codeop.tech/) bootcamp  
🔭  I’m currently refactoring the CSS of my [Step By Step's project](https://github.com/icodebyamanda/sxs_beta) to become more scalable...   
🙏 ...and so 'future me' can thank 'today me' for having made future developments much smoother *(can you picture that?)*  
🌱 Upcoming learning: further digging into data structures and databases... I am weirdly attracted to this topic.  

 ✔️ Other than that: 
 - 🥐  I am based in Paris 
- 👀  I have 8 years professional experience including 2 years in tech
- 🦸🏽‍♀️  I was an Agile Delivery Manager, a Waterfall Project Manager, a Business Unit Manager...
- ... You name it.

⚡ 💛 ⚡ I am particularly interested in:
- privacy
- cybersecurity
- engineering biais
- web literacy
- gender studies 
- community organisation  

Please **hit me up** if I can help (including on Open Source projects).

😄 Oh and my pronouns are '**She/Her'**, thanks ✌🏽 !
